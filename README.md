<h1> Docker and Github Action:</h1>
By using a configured yml file and linking github to dockerhub using the token included in the secret, github is able to automatically push changes made to the repo to dockerhub, where the code is able to be pulled from as a docker desktop image.
This can then be run as any other container.
Github actions enable our work to be saved to the dockerhub cloud without the need for manual entry.
